# IDEAS.md - Roadmap

This document outlines the desired features and improvements. Jules should use this as a reference.

## 1. Refactoring & Organization (High Priority)
*   **Decouple Monolithic Files:**
    *   Separate logic from UI (JS out of HTML, CSS out of HTML).
*   **Directory Structure:**
    *   Organize scattered files into app-specific folders.
    *   Clean up legacy backup files after verification.

## 2. Universal Features (UI/UX & Performance)
*   **Fully Responsive & Mobile-First:** Ensure layout integrity on all devices.
*   **Dark Mode Support:** Implement automatic theme switching and manual toggle.
*   **Performance:** Optimize execution speed.

## 3. Security & Quality (Robustness)
*   **Data Persistence:** Real-time saving of inputs to localStorage.
*   **Strict Input Validation:** Sanitize inputs to prevent errors.
*   **Error Monitoring:** Implement global error handlers.
